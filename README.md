The extension of this work is under review.

## Main findings

We compare multiple atom representations for graph neural networks and evaluate them on the prediction of free energy, solubility, and metabolic stability in order to understand the impact of selected atomic features on the model's performance.

We find that not all atomic features are equally usefull and that removing some of them can improve the performance.

P-values of one-tailed Wilcoxon tests between the best models trained on each representation.

The value in i-th row and j-th column corresponds to the alternative hypothesis saying that the median squared error of i-th representation is greater than the median of j-th representation (superior representations have darker columns, and inferior ones have darker rows). The darkest cells are statistically significant with Bonferroni correction.

### Running the code

 To train GCNs, use this command:

```bash
python main.py model.cfg dataset.cfg representation.cfg results_dir
```
Examples of configs can be found in directory `configs`.

To train D-MPNNs, use this command:

```bash
python main_dmpnn.py model.cfg dataset.cfg representation.cfg results_dir
```


To run Wilcoxon tests and generate p-value heatmaps, use this command:

```bash
python run_wilcoxon.py --model [model name] --source [results directory]
```

To calculate explanations with GNNExplainer, use this command:

```bash
python calculate_explanations.py results_dir dataset run fold [--savedir saving_dir] [--supersafe]
```

To calculate statistics for GNNExplainer explanations, use this command:

```bash
python analyse_explanations.py results_dir
```
